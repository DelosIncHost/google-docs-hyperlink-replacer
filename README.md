This Google Apps Script automates the process of converting hyperlink titles or texts, typically collected from Google search results, into their corresponding URLs within a document. It streamlines the task of managing multiple links by replacing the displayed text with the actual clickable URLs, making it easier to navigate directly to the linked content. This script is particularly useful for efficiently organizing and handling large sets of links gathered during research or online data collection.
